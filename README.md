### **About This Repository**  
This repository houses all projects completed during my enrollment in the **[100 Days of Code: Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course**, taught by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to Python, covering diverse applications to build a versatile programming foundation.  

---

### **My Learning Goals**  
My primary focus is to **master Python for data-driven fields**, with an emphasis on:  
- **Data Science** (analysis, visualization, modeling)  
- **Artificial Intelligence** (machine learning, automation)  

I chose this course to gain a **broad understanding of Pythonâ€™s capabilities**, ensuring I can tackle varied challenges with confidence.  

---

### **What Youâ€™ll Find Here**  
The projects reflect Pythonâ€™s versatility, spanning topics such as:  
- **Data Science** 
- **Automation**
- **Web Development** 
- **Game Development** 
- **Desktop/Mobile Apps** 

Each project includes **unique enhancements** beyond the course requirements to push my skills further.

### **My Approach: Creativity & Challenge**  
A core principle of my learning journey is to **exceed expectations** and innovate. For every project, I:  
1. **Add complexity** to the original task.  
2. **Integrate new concepts** (e.g., loops, conditionals, libraries).  
3. **Prioritize originality** to create distinctive solutions.  

**Example: Day 1**  
- *Course Task:* A simple band name generator (combining city + pet name).  
- *My Version:* A riddle using **conditional logic** (`if/else`), **loops** (`while True`), and **user input validation** for a richer experience.

### **Whatâ€™s Next?**  
After completing the course, I plan to:  
1. Transition into **data science and IA projects**.  
**stay tuned!**
