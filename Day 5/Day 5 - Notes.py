# Loops

# For Loops
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruits)
    print(fruit + "pie")
# In this case, the loop went through one item in the list and placed it in the output, and the code went through one of the fruits and placed it in the output. As it is a loop, it goes back and does the same with the next fruit, and so on.
